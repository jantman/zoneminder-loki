# zoneminder-loki

Docker image to ship ZoneMinder logs to Loki

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

**IMPORTANT:** This is a personal project only. PRs are accepted, but this is not supported and "issues" will likely not be fixed or responded to. This is only for people who understand the details of everything invovled.

## Description

This is a very simple daemon that polls [ZoneMinder](https://zoneminder.com/)'s MySQL database for new log messages (in the ZoneMinder `Logs` table, the same one that drives the "Log" section of the UI) every N seconds (default 10) and ships them to [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/). This is intended as a way to get ZM's logs out of their walled-garden database table and into (1) the same place _all_ of your other logs are, and (2) somewhere that can alert on problems in a meaningful way.

## Usage

This is really only intended to be run in Docker; if you need to run it locally, make your environment like the Docker container.

```
docker run \
    jantman/zoneminder-loki:latest
```

### Environment Variables

* `LOKI_URL` (**required**) - Loki URL to ship logs to; e.g. `http://my-loki-instance/loki/api/v1/push`
* `ZM_DB_HOST` (**required**) - ZoneMinder MySQL database hostname (or IP address)
* `ZM_DB_USER` (**required**) - ZoneMinder MySQL database username
* `ZM_DB_PASS` (**required**) - ZoneMinder MySQL database password
* `ZM_DB_NAME` (**required**) - ZoneMinder MySQL database name
* `POLL_SECONDS` (_optional_) - Integer number of seconds for how often to poll MySQL for log messages; default 10
* `BACKFILL_MINUTES` (_optional_) - If the pointer file does not exist, how many minutes worth of logs to backfill into Loki; default 60
* `POINTER_PATH` (_optional_) - Path to the pointer position file; default `/pointer.txt`

## Debugging

For debugging, append `-v` to your `docker run` command, to run the entrypoint with debug-level logging.

## Development

Clone the repo, then in your clone:

```
python3 -mvenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Release Process

Tag the repo. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jantman/zoneminder-loki/actions) will run a Docker build, push to Docker Hub and GHCR (GitHub Container Registry), and create a release on the repo.
